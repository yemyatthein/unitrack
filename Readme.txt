Android application. This is eclipse project.

Tracking apps on Android have a set of common features such as data entry, search, reminder alarm, etc. What if we have an app that you can customize as you want and have all those common features. For instance, you can make a drinking tracker by editing a UI setting and allow you to track your drinking habit. No need to buy new tracker for every aspect of your life. You can simple config by yourself and you got your tracker.
